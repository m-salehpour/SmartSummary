      "text": "On. All right, team, let's commence this briefing. Our objective today is to finalize the strategy for Operation Blue Nebula. We have 10 minutes. Let's do updates first. Colonel Vortetz, the floor is yours. Thank you, General. Recon drones have scanned the north quadrant of Oridia. Enemy fortifications are present, with a heavy concentration of anti-aircraft turrets protecting the command center. It'll be a tough shell to crack. That matches our satellite intel. I propose we deploy ground forces at the eastern ridge for a surprise offensive. It's less fortifying and could give us the element of surprise. So yeah, a surprise attack is viable, but we can't disregard the aerial assault. My squadrons can provide air support, neutralizing the turrets before our ground troops move in. I suggest we use the Seraphun stealth units. They can disable the turret silently before the main assault. minimizing our exposure. I concur with Onyx. Additionally, we can deploy electronic warfare teams to disrupt their communications, causing confusion in their ranks. I agree, but stealth is key. Major Skye, coordinate with Captain Stryker on integrating the stealth units with the aerial plan. Colonel Vortex, how soon can we mobilize? If we fast track, perhaps. We can probably be ready within about 48 hours. However, we'll need to ensure our cyber teams are ready to counter any electronic interference during the operation. Agreed. I'll have my tech specialists work with the cyber team to establish secure comms and jam enemy signals. My pilots are ready on standby, so no issue there. We'll need detailed maps and enemy positions for a precise strike. Lieutenant Commander Otix, can your team provide that? I mean, absolutely. The stealth units can relay real-time data to your fleet, Captain. We'll also sabotage any long-range comms the enemy has to isolate their command center. I'll have my electronic warfare teams coordinate with Onyx's units. If we time it right, we can cause a total blackout for their forces during the assault. Excellent. I want full integration between units. This operation hinges on coordination. Colonel Vortex, oversee this joint operation, make sure everyone has what they need to be successful. Yes, General. Right away, sir. I'll set up a joint task force and immediately to ensure all teams are briefly equipped. Time is of the essence, guys. Remember, the element of surprise is paramount. Any leaks? We might as well be walking into a slaughterhouse, guys. Security protocols, they must be airtight in this operation. So will there be any civilian considerations, sir? Eastern Ridge is pretty close to those mining colonies. Evacuation plans are already in place. We can't risk collateral damage. Captain Stryker, coordinate with local enforcement to ensure that we have a smooth operation. Hell yeah, General. I'll liaise with the planetary defense corps and make sure the civilians are moved to safety. Before we break, I want to stress logistics. We need to ensure our supply lines are secure and operational prior to the offensive. I'll audit our current munitions stockpile. Can't afford to run low mid-fight. Agreed. And my engineers will need to inspect the fighter jets to ensure they're battle ready. I'll coordinate with the engineers. Stealth tech requires special attention. I'll have the electronic warfare teams double check our jamming equipment. We can't afford any malfunction during the operation. Very well then. Logistics and readiness are crucial. Now let's discuss contingency plans. Skye, what's our fallback in case we encounter heavier resistance than what we expect? Glad you asked, General. We have the Titan mechs on standby. They can be deployed to reinforce our troops and push through enemy lines. Our mechs are powerful. but they're also a beacon for enemy fire. We'll need to protect them adequately. Don't worry, Vortex. My squadron could provide a defensive perimeter for the Titans. I'll keep the enemy's heavy weapons busy. And my stealth units can take out any threats that slip through. Boom. Consider it done. In the event of electronic warfare, my teams will ensure that the enemy's targeting systems are compromised, making it harder for them to focus fire on the Titans. Excellent. And what about enemy prisoners? How are we going to handle them? Vortex? Yes, I've been thinking about that. We prepared secure transport vehicles to take the enemy prisoners to the holding facility Delta. Interrogation teams are on standby. We should also be aware of any intel the other prisoners might provide. Could be critical for subsequent missions. Nothing like some waterboarding. Speaking of intel, We should have a debriefing team ready to analyze data immediately after the operation. And my team can prepare the Mobile Command Center for on-site debriefings and analysis. I'll ensure that any captured enemy comms are immediately decoded for actionable intelligence. Good. Efficiency and intel gathering could turn the tides of this war, guys. With your permission, General, I'll start drafting the operation orders and distribute them to each unit by 0600 hours. Permission granted. vortex. Ensure those orders are encrypted. We cannot accept risk of interception. I'll get our comms team to set up encrypted channels for the operation. Over. And I'll have my squad run through combat sims this evening. We need to be freaking sharp. I'll schedule stealth and evasion drills for my team. We cannot afford any mistakes. and my teams will conduct electronic warfare drills to ensure our systems are fully operational. That's the spirit, Valor. Remember, everyone, this is more than just another battle. We're fighting for the future of Eridia. These citizens rely on us to keep them safe and to push back these invaders. They won't let you down, Sheriff. We'll ensure that. Right, Skye? It ain't just about winning the battle. It's about how we win. Our integrity as a force must be upheld. Yeah, we'll show them the might of Iridia, but also the honor of our forces. Stealth and precision are my team's guiding principles. We'll strike without them even knowing what hit them. And our electronic warfare teams will make sure the enemy is blinded, deafened, and disoriented. Good deal, Valor. Let's maintain that mindset. Iridia doesn't just need warriors, it needs heroes. people who can inspire, people that can lead by example. Absolutely, sir. Our actions today will be remembered for generations. We carry that responsibility. Speaking of which, responsibility that is, I'll coordinate with the medical teams to ensure they're prepared for any casualties. My team's survival training will be put to the test, but I think we've prepared for this. We've all been through the simulations, but the real thing, it's different. We'll be ready for that unpredictability of war. And my teams are well-versed in adapting to electronic warfare scenarios. We'll be ready to counter any surprises. Indeed. War is the ultimate test of our resolve. But remember, we're not just fighting for victory. We're fighting to bring our people peace. Roger that, sir. Let's bring them peace through decisive combat. And we won't even know what hit them. We've got the element of surprise and superior tactics. Hot damn. And not to mention the best damn fighters in the galaxy. Our squads are unmatched. With stealth on our side, we'll be the sun blade that secures victory. And our electronic warfare teams will ensure that the enemy is left in the dark unable to respond. We are the shield of Iridia and the sword that defends our home. Let's make sure that sword strikes true. Every logistic, every bullet, every strategy is geared towards victory. We've trained for this. Our troops are ready. And our fighters are primed. The sky belongs to us. And the shadows are our allies. We move unseen, but our impact will be felt. Our electronic warfare will ensure the enemy systems fail them when they need them most. Then it's settled, gentlemen. Operation Blue Nebula is in full effect. Let's show them the might of our united forces. Let's make Orinia great again, guys. Dismissed.",
